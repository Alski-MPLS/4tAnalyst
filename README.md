# 4tAnalyst

An AI assistant for firewall change request analysis. Engineers interact with it through [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) using slash commands — 4tAnalyst handles policy research, standards validation, and peer review package generation, keeping the engineer as the final decision-maker.

## Who this is for

4tAnalyst is a reference implementation of an MCP-based firewall change-analysis
assistant, built for a real production deployment in a regulated, critical-infrastructure
environment. The deterministic planning
core (rule coverage, object reuse, insertion-point analysis, CLI generation) is
fully usable standalone via [fortigate-change-planner](https://github.com/Alski-MPLS/fortigate-change-planner)
against any FortiManager instance.

The full system in this repo — the unified MCP server, per-domain tool servers,
engineer slash-command skills, feedback/audit store — additionally expects a
live "zone policy" API (`zone_mcp`) that classifies IPs into named network zones
and returns allow/block verdicts. That API is specific to this deployment; to run
the full system elsewhere, implement `zone_mcp`'s three endpoints
(`/zone/query`, `/zone/zones`, `/zone/policies` — see `zone_mcp/client.py`)
against your own network segmentation source of truth, and populate
`standards_mcp/naming.yaml` / `review_requirements.yaml` with your own
conventions.

## What it does

Firewall engineers typically spend significant time on rule request processing: parsing incoming requests, identifying which firewalls are affected, researching existing rules, checking against segmentation policy, validating naming and logging standards, and assembling peer review documentation. 4tAnalyst automates that research layer, reducing it to judgment calls.

Given source IP(s), destination IP(s), and service(s) — a single value or a list of each — 4tAnalyst will:

- Resolve IPs to network zones and return a policy verdict (ALLOWED / BLOCKED / UNKNOWN) for every source×destination×service combination; IPs that don't resolve to any zone default to the catch-all **Internet** zone (critical risk) rather than silently failing
- Plan **one consolidated policy per firewall** covering all combinations, refusing to consolidate when policy gives mixed verdicts (some combinations allowed, some blocked — the request must be split)
- Search named firewalls for existing rules that match or overlap the request (set-semantics matching — service objects resolved to numeric port ranges, address groups recursed, coverage judged only against rules scoped to the flow's actual interfaces)
- Decide which address/service objects can be reused and which must be created, auto-creating an address group when a side has more than 3 members (or a named group on request)
- Compute where a new rule must be inserted in the policy package (first-match shadowing analysis)
- Offer a smaller **Option B** when a near-miss rule exists: append the missing endpoint(s) to an address group that rule already references — always accompanied by the full blast radius (every other rule that group change would affect)
- Validate proposed object names and logging settings against your standards
- Determine the required approval chain based on zone risk classification
- Generate a complete peer review package for the second-engineer sign-off
- Write an HTML report and a ready-to-use FortiGate CLI config (or exception-request language, if blocked) that engineers attach directly to the change ticket

All of that analysis runs in the **deterministic change planner**
([`fortigate-change-planner`](https://github.com/Alski-MPLS/fortigate-change-planner),
importable as `fgplanner`) — tested Python code, no LLM in the decision path.
Claude Code is the conversational front end: it collects the request, calls
the planner's `plan_change` tool, and presents the result. The same engine
runs standalone:

```
python -m fgplanner --src "10.1.2.3, 10.1.2.4" --dst 10.9.8.7 \
    --service "tcp/8443, tcp/22" --firewall SITE01-FW01:OT-ADOM \
    --ticket CHG0012345 [--src-group GRP_VENDOR_X]
```

`fgplanner` deliberately ships no default FortiManager/zone-policy clients and
reads no credentials file — you register your own client factories at
startup (see `fgplanner/clients.py` in that repo). Inside this repo, that
wiring is already done for you in `fwanalyst_server/server.py`, which builds
factories from `credentials.yaml` and registers them before every
`plan_change` call — so the supported way to exercise the planner here is via
the `plan_change` MCP tool (`uv run python -m fwanalyst_server`), not by
running `python -m fgplanner` unwired from this checkout.

**What it does not do:** push changes to firewalls, bypass peer review, or make decisions. All operations are read-only against the management APIs.

**Important limitations:**
- Does not automatically discover which firewalls sit in the traffic path. The submitting engineer must identify and name the affected devices. Automated path suggestion is a planned future feature.
- All verdicts and recommendations are advisory. Engineers are accountable for every decision — the tool accelerates research, it does not replace judgment.
- Zone policy verdicts reflect *intended segmentation policy*, not the actual current state of firewall rules. ALLOWED does not mean a rule exists on the firewall.

Design rule: **the LLM orchestrates, code computes.** Everything that must be
right — rule coverage, object reuse, insertion point, CLI — is computed by
[`fortigate-change-planner`](https://github.com/Alski-MPLS/fortigate-change-planner)
(the `fgplanner` package, a dependency of `fwanalyst_server`) and covered by
its own unit tests. Firewall credentials live only on the
central server; engineers authenticate to it with a bearer token (per-engineer
identity planned for Phase 4). Engineers never need direct API access. TLS can
be terminated directly by the server (`FW_ANALYST_SSL_CERTFILE`/`FW_ANALYST_SSL_KEYFILE`)
or by a reverse proxy in front of it — see [docs/tls-setup.md](docs/tls-setup.md).

## Quick start

1. Clone this repo on the central MCP server
2. Copy `credentials.yaml.example` to `credentials.yaml` and fill in API credentials
3. Install all packages and start the servers — see [Installation](docs/installation.md)
4. On each engineer laptop, point Claude Code at the central server — see [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)
5. Open any directory in Claude Code and type `/analyze-request`

Running tests and CI

- Unit tests: `pytest -q tests/` (matching, auth, and client tests in this repo — no live systems needed; the deterministic planner's own matching/insertion/engine/CLI tests live in [`fortigate-change-planner`](https://github.com/Alski-MPLS/fortigate-change-planner))
- Smoke tests: `uv run python scripts/run_smoke.py` or `./scripts/smoke-test.sh` (asserts auth is enforced on port 8000)
- CI: GitHub Actions runs `build-dev-image`, `unit-tests`, and `smoke-tests` on pushes and PRs to `main`.
